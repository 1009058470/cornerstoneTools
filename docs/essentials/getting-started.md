# Getting Started

> We will be using [ES2015](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) in the code samples in the guide.

Cornerstone.js provides a rock solid foundation for creating a web medical image viewer. However, it is purposefully light weight and extensible. After configuring an image loader (getting your images to display), the next thing you'll want to do is manipulate those images, apply annotations, and provide additional tools for diagnosis and research. CornerstoneTools sets out to provide tools for these common use cases. Here's a basic example:

### HTML

``` html
<script src=""></script>
<script src=""></script>

<div>
</div>
```

### JavaScript

``` js
// 0. Tiny blurb about importing modules and registering externals
// 1. MVP setup for enabling common tools and enabling different types of input
```

Now that Cornerstone and CornerstoneTools are setup, we can configure and enable tools for each enabled canvas:

```js
```
