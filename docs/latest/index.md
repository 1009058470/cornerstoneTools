## What is CornerstoneTools.js {#what-is-cornerstone-tools-js}

Cornerstone Tools is a javascript library that assist in annotating, segmenting, and measuring medical images. This library also provides a framework for creating new tools, managing all tools in a consistent cohesive manner, and importing/exporting tool measurement data.

This library is not stand-alone. It builds on top of [Cornerstone](https://cornerstonejs.org/); a standards compliant, fast, and extensible JavaScript library that displays interactive medical images.
